                    <h3>Project 1: OptiFuse CRM Implementation </h3>
                    <p>In my MIS 306 course, our team worked on the implementation of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for OptiFuse, a company specializing in overcurrent and voltage protection devices. The project aimed to enhance operational efficiency by addressing existing data management and customer service challenges. We proposed a CRM solution that centralized customer information, reduced data redundancy, and improved real-time decision-making. The project also highlighted the significant ROI and operational improvements OptiFuse could achieve by adopting the system. This collaborative project taught me the importance of working in a team to troubleshoot, integrate, and deliver a functional solution, which ultimately benefitted the company in a highly competitive market.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2: Python-Based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Underwater Drone System</h3>
                    <p>As an IT & Software Development Intern at the Library & Information Center of ATEI, I developed a GUI that interfaced with underwater drone sensors, visualizing critical data parameters such as density, pH levels, temperature, and pressure. This system improved monitoring and data-driven decision-making, and was key in enhancing the drone system's analytical capabilities.
