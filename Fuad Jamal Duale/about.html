            <h2><strong>About Me</strong> </h2>
            <p>My name is Fuad Jamal Duale, and I'm a Management Information Systems student at San Diego State
                University.
                Hello! I’m Fuad Jamal Duale, a dedicated student at San Diego State University, where I'm pursuing a
                Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems alongside a minor in Computer Science. This
                combination of studies has provided me with a well-rounded understanding of both business operations and
                technological advancements.</p>

                <p>Currently, I serve as an IT Help Desk Specialist at Iftin Charter School. In this role, I support both
                staff and students by troubleshooting hardware and network issues, managing our network infrastructure,
                and performing proactive maintenance to ensure our systems run smoothly. Collaborating with educators, I
                help integrate learning technologies such as smartboards and projectors to enhance the educational
                experience.</p>

                <p>I’ve also gained valuable experience as an IT & Software Development Intern at the Library & Information
                Center of ATEI in Thessaloniki, Greece. A highlight of my internship was developing a Python-based
                Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an underwater drone system. This project involved interfacing with
                various sensors and visualizing crucial data in real-time, aiding the team in making informed decisions.</p>

                <p>In my academic journey, I participated in a significant group project for my MIS 306 course, where we
                designed and implemented a user-friendly e-commerce platform. This experience taught me the value of
                teamwork as we collaborated to troubleshoot and refine our system, resulting in a functional and
                scalable solution.</p>

                <p>Outside of my studies and work, I am an active member of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)
                at SDSU and the SDSU Cyber Security Defense Team. These organizations help me deepen my knowledge in
                cybersecurity and connect with industry professionals.</p>

                <p>My aspiration is to build a fulfilling and stable career in IT, cybersecurity, or biotechnology. I am
                passionate about ongoing learning and growth in these areas, and I eagerly anticipate the opportunities
                that await.</p>
            </p>
